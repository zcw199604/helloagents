## Why HelloAGENTS

Many assistants can analyze tasks but often stop before real delivery. HelloAGENTS adds strict routing, staged execution, and verification gates.

| Challenge | Without HelloAGENTS | With HelloAGENTS |
|---|---|---|
| Stops at planning | Ends with suggestions | Pushes to implementation and validation |
| Output drift | Different structure every prompt | Unified routing and stage chain |
| Risky operations | Easier to make destructive mistakes | EHRB risk detection and escalation |
| Knowledge continuity | Context gets scattered | Built-in KB and session memory |
| Reusability | Prompt-by-prompt effort | Commandized reusable workflow |

## What Changed vs Legacy Repo

Compared with legacy multi-bundle releases, the v2.x line is now package-first with a fundamentally different architecture.

| Area | Legacy repo | Current repo |
|---|---|---|
| Distribution | Multiple bundle folders per CLI | One Python package + installer CLI |
| Installation | Manual copy of config and skill folders | pip/uv install + `helloagents` interactive menu |
| Routing | Three-layer (Context → Tools → Intent) | Five-dimension scoring (R0–R3) |
| Workflow stages | 4 stages (Evaluate, Analyze, Design, Develop) | 3 stages (Evaluate, Design, Develop) + R1 fast flow, with sub-agent dispatch |
| Agent system | None | RLM with 5 specialized roles + native sub-agents and session isolation |
| Memory | No persistence | Three-layer: L0 user, L1 project KB, L2 session |
| Safety | Basic EHRB | Three-layer EHRB (keyword + semantic + tool output) |
| Hooks | None | Auto-deploy lifecycle hooks (Claude Code 9 events + Codex CLI notify) |
| CLI targets | 5 visible bundle targets | 6 targets: codex, claude, gemini, qwen, grok, opencode |
| Commands | 12 | 15 workflow commands |

> ⚠️ **Migration notice:** Because repository structure and installation workflow changed in v2.x, legacy versions were moved to **helloagents-archive**: https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents-archive

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<img src="./readme_images/02-feature-icon-installer.svg" width="48" align="left">

**RLM sub-agent orchestration**

5 specialized roles (reviewer, synthesizer, kb_keeper, pkg_keeper, writer) plus host CLI native sub-agents (explore/implement/test/design) are dispatched automatically based on task complexity, with session isolation per CLI instance. Supports cross-CLI parallel scheduling and Agent Teams collaboration.

**Your gain:** complex tasks are broken down and handled by the right specialist, with parallel execution when possible.
</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<img src="./readme_images/03-feature-icon-workflow.svg" width="48" align="left">

**Five-dimension routing (R0–R3)**

Every input is scored on action need, target clarity, decision scope, impact range, and EHRB risk — then routed to R0 direct response, R1 fast flow, R2 simplified flow, or R3 standard flow.

**Your gain:** proportional effort — simple queries stay fast, complex tasks get full process.
</td>

<td width="50%" valign="top">
<img src="./readme_images/04-feature-icon-safety.svg" width="48" align="left">

**Three-layer safety detection (EHRB)**

Keyword scan, semantic analysis, and tool-output inspection catch destructive operations before execution. Interactive and delegated modes enforce user confirmation.

**Your gain:** safer defaults with zero-config protection.
</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<img src="./readme_images/05-feature-icon-compat.svg" width="48" align="left">

**Three-layer memory model**

L0 user memory (global preferences), L1 project knowledge base (structured docs synced from code), and L2 session summaries (auto-persisted at stage transitions).

**Your gain:** context survives across sessions and projects.

## Quick Start

### Method A: One-line install script (recommended)

**macOS / Linux:**

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | bash

**Windows PowerShell:**

    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

> The script auto-detects `uv` or `pip`, installs the HelloAGENTS package, and launches an interactive menu for you to select target CLIs. Re-running performs an update.

**Update:**

    helloagents update

### Method B: npx (Node.js >= 16)

    npx helloagents

> Installs the Python package and launches an interactive menu. You can also specify directly: `npx helloagents install codex` (or use `npx -y` to auto-download without prompting)

> Requires Python >= 3.10. After first install, use the native `helloagents` command directly.

> **Acknowledgment:** Thanks to @setsuna1106 for generously transferring the npm `helloagents` package ownership.

### Method C: UV (isolated environment)

**Step 0 — Install UV first (skip if already installed):**

    # Windows PowerShell
    irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex

    # macOS / Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

> After installing UV, restart your terminal to make the `uv` command available.

> ⚠️ Windows PowerShell 5.1 does not support `&&`. Please run commands separately, or upgrade to [PowerShell 7+](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows).

**Install and select targets (one command):**

    uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents helloagents && helloagents

> Installs the package and launches an interactive menu for you to select target CLIs. You can also specify directly: `helloagents install codex`

**Update:**

    helloagents update

### Method D: pip (Python >= 3.10)

**Install and select targets (one command):**

    pip install git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents.git && helloagents

> Installs the package and launches an interactive menu for you to select target CLIs. You can also specify directly: `helloagents install codex`

**Update:**

    pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents.git

### Install HelloAgents for different CLI targets

    helloagents                  # interactive menu

    helloagents install codex    # specify target directly

    helloagents install --all    # install to all detected CLIs

### Verify

    helloagents status

    helloagents version

### Uninstall

    helloagents uninstall codex

    helloagents uninstall --all

### Clean caches

    helloagents clean

### Codex CLI example

**First install:**

    # One-line script (recommended, auto-launches interactive menu after install)
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | bash

    # Windows PowerShell
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

    # npx (or use npx -y to auto-download without prompting)
    npx helloagents install codex

    # UV
    uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents helloagents && helloagents install codex

    # pip
    pip install git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents.git && helloagents install codex

**Update later (auto-syncs installed targets):**

    helloagents update

> ⚠️ **Codex CLI config.toml compatibility notes:** The following settings may affect HelloAGENTS:
> - `[features]` `steer = true` — changes input submission behavior, may interfere with workflow interaction
> - `[features]` `child_agents_md = true` — experimental, injects extra instructions that may conflict with HelloAGENTS
> - `project_doc_max_bytes` too low — default 32KB, AGENTS.md will be truncated (auto-set to 98304 during install)
> - `agent_max_depth = 1` — limits sub-agent nesting depth, recommend keeping default or ≥2
> - `agent_max_threads` too low — default 6, lower values limit parallel sub-agent scheduling

### Claude Code example

**First install:**

    # One-line script (recommended, auto-launches interactive menu after install)
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | bash

    # Windows PowerShell
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

    # npx (or use npx -y to auto-download without prompting)
    npx helloagents install claude

    # UV
    uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents helloagents && helloagents install claude

    # pip
    pip install git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents.git && helloagents install claude

**Update later (auto-syncs installed targets):**

    helloagents update

### Beta branch

To install from the `beta` branch, append `@beta` to the repository URL:

    # One-line script (auto-launches interactive menu after install)
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/beta/install.sh | HELLOAGENTS_BRANCH=beta bash

    # Windows PowerShell
    $env:HELLOAGENTS_BRANCH="beta"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/beta/install.ps1 | iex

    # npx (or use npx -y to auto-download without prompting)
    npx helloagents@beta

    # UV
    uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents@beta helloagents && helloagents

    # pip
    pip install git+https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents.git@beta && helloagents

## How It Works

1. Install the package (script/pip/uv) and run `helloagents` to launch an interactive menu for selecting target CLIs (or specify directly with `helloagents install <target>`). Hooks and SKILL.md are auto-deployed during installation.
2. In AI chat, every input is scored on five dimensions and routed to R0–R3.
3. R2/R3 tasks enter the stage chain: EVALUATE → DESIGN → DEVELOP. R1 fast flow handles single-point operations directly.
4. RLM dispatches native sub-agents and specialized roles based on task complexity. Supports parallel scheduling and Agent Teams for complex tasks.
5. EHRB scans each step for destructive operations; risky actions require explicit user confirmation. Hooks provide additional pre-tool safety checks when available.
6. Three-layer memory (user / project KB / session) preserves context across sessions.
7. Stage chain completes with verified output and optional knowledge base sync.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ~auto | full autonomous workflow |
| ~plan | planning and package generation |
| ~exec | execute existing package |
| ~init | initialize knowledge base |
| ~upgradekb | upgrade knowledge structure |
| ~clean / ~cleanplan | cleanup workflow artifacts |
| ~test / ~review / ~validatekb | quality checks |

| ~rlm | role orchestration (spawn / agents / resume / team) |
| ~status / ~help | status and help |

## FAQ

- Q: Is this a Python CLI tool or prompt package?
  A: Both. CLI manages installation; workflow behavior comes from AGENTS.md and helloagents docs.

- Q: Which target should I install?
  A: Use the CLI you run: codex, claude, gemini, qwen, grok, or opencode.

- Q: What if a rules file already exists?
  A: Non-HelloAGENTS files are backed up before replacement.

- Q: What is RLM?
  A: Role Language Model — a sub-agent orchestration system with 5 specialized roles + native CLI sub-agents dispatched based on task complexity.

- Q: Where does project knowledge go?
  A: In the project-local `.helloagents/` directory, auto-synced when code changes.

- Q: Does memory persist across sessions?
  A: Yes. L0 user memory is global, L1 project KB is per-project, L2 session summaries are auto-saved at stage transitions.

- Q: What are Hooks?
  A: Lifecycle hooks auto-deployed during installation. Claude Code gets 9 event hooks (safety checks, progress snapshots, KB sync, etc.); Codex CLI gets a notify hook for update checks. All optional — features degrade gracefully without hooks.

- Q: What is Agent Teams?
  A: An experimental Claude Code multi-agent collaboration mode. Multiple Claude Code instances work as teammates with shared task lists and mailbox communication, mapped to RLM roles. Falls back to standard Task sub-agents when unavailable.

## Troubleshooting

- command not found: ensure install path is in PATH
- package version unknown: install package first for metadata
- target not detected: launch target CLI once to create config directory
- custom rules overwritten: restore from timestamped backup in CLI config dir
- images not rendering: keep relative paths and commit readme_images files
